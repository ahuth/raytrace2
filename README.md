# Raytrace 2

Follow-up to https://github.com/ahuth/raytrace, this implements a raytracer by following [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), by Peter Shirley.

## Usage

Generate the image by running the following command:

```
yarn generate
```

A git-ignored `image.ppm` file will be generated at the root of the project.
